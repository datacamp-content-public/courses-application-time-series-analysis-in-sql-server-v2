## Computing simple arithmetic moving averages

`@script`
We will be computing moving averages for numerical time series data sets. Moving averages are fundamental to analysing past trends and patterns to help with decision making going forward into the future. At the end of the lesson we will be able to split time series data into granular periods, compute moving averages for any time lag to get a good understanding of past data trends.

## Setting up the date parameters of the data set-breaking down time into manageable pieces

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "a775f65724"
```

`@part1`
```
```
select 
year(date) as Y, month(date) as M, day(date) as D, *  
from dbo.data

```


`@script`
The numerical time series we have on hand is categorised by dd-mm-yy. We want to add year month day fields to the data to be able to select data with ease according to the time frame we would like to work with. 

We use the date, month and year functions to create additional columns to the time series data set. When this is run 3 extra columns will appear, which will allow us to work with the data with ease down the track allowing us to group and isolate the data by a certain year, month or day. This will simplify our work and should be the first step to take when working with time series data.

## Creating row numbers

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "2faa157ac2"
```

`@part1`
```

select a.*, row_number() over (partition by y order by y) as RowNumber
	from
	(
		select 
		year(date) as Y, 
                month(date) as M, 
                day(date) as D, *  
		from dbo.data
	) A

```


`@script`
To calculate moving averages we need a way to reference data going back in time. For example, for a 10 day moving average we need to access data for the past 10 days inclusive of the current day. 

How do we do this? We need to create row numbers in ascending order and then reference back the number of time lags. In this step we use the row_number() function to create a row column as a reference point for time. How far back in time we need to go can be determined from this reference point to calculate moving averages. 

Our data set is for an entire year, or 365 days. We partition by year and order the data by year to create a new row column in ascending order for the entire year. This then can be used in the next step, to calculate moving averages based on a predefined time lag.

## Putting it all together to create simple moving averages

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "a55c9c60c2"
```

`@part1`
'''

select b.*, case when RowNumber>9 then avg(b.bank_account_balance) over (order by b.RowNumber rows 9 preceding) end as MACash10, 
case when rownumber>19 then avg(b.bank_account_balance) over (order by b.rownumber rows 19 preceding) end as MACash20
from
(
	select a.*, row_number() over (partition by y order by y) as RowNumber
	from
	(
		select 
		year(date) as Y, month(date) as M, day(date) as D, *  
		from dbo.data
	) A
) B


'''


`@script`
We will create moving averages of 10 and 20 days using the time period reference period column we created in the previous exercise. To do this, we create an outer nested query.

We will create 2 new columns, 1 for 10 day moving average, 1 for 20 day moving average. 

In a SQL block we will create the moving average and ensure it only calculates if there is enough data going back in time to calculate that moving average. 


```
case when RowNumber>9 then avg(b.bank_account_balance) over (order by b.RowNumber rows 9 preceding) end as MACash10 

```

This code block uses the row number column we created previously and gives us the moving average of the past 10 time series data points and ignores the calculation if there is less than 10 data points, ignoring the first 9 instances where there is not enough data to compute. This is controlled by the case when statement. 

We use the average statement over rows preceding to compute this calculation. 

Similarly we can apply this calculation for a 20 day moving average and so on and so forth.

When the entire code block is run, we have our 2 new columns of moving average data side by side.

## Lesson Summary

```yaml
type: "FinalSlide"
key: "9f4dc1d849"
```

`@script`
We have learned to strip out date information to be able to isolate certain times of the year using Year() Month() Date() functions.

Then we created row numbers for our time series data using the Row_Number() function. 

Finally we learned to create 10 and 20 day moving averages using the Order By Rows Preceding function.
