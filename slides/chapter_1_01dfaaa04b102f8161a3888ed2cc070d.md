`@script`
We will be computing moving averages for numerical data encountered in all time series data sets. Moving averages are fundamental to analysing past trends and patterns in time series data. By the end of the lesson you will be able to split time series data by date, month, year, and compute moving averages for any given time period time lag to get a better understanding of the data.
