`@script`
We will be computing moving averages for numerical data encountered in all time series data sets. Moving averages are fundamental to analysing past trends and patterns in time series data. By the end of the lesson you will be able to split time series data by date, month, year, and compute moving averages for any given time period time lag to get a better understanding of the data.

## Setting up the date parameters of the data set

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "a775f65724"
```

`@part1`
```
select 
year(date) as Y, month(date) as M, day(date) as D, *  
from dbo.data

```


`@script`
We numerical data for an entire year but the date is in the format yymmdd. We want to add year month day fields to the data as a first step so we can utilise the additional information to pinpoint the time series data we would like to work with at ease. We use the date, month and date functions to create additional columns to the time series data set. When this is run you can see that the extra columns will appear, which will allow us to create moving averages of the numerical information down the track by grouping by year, month or day.
